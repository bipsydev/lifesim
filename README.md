# cpp17-template
 My personal project template for general C++17 projects using VS Code. <br>
 It comes with a simple terminal example program that shows how to read runtime arguments sent to the program <i>using a linked list</i> and also how to compile code for different platforms. The `LinkedList` is an example class that shows how to structure a class or file that contains template and non-template functions. This repo is completely preconfigured for a barebones C++ github repository and can be used out of the box for simple terminal programs.
